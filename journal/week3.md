**Decentralized Authentication** is the key to advancing in the future, and now it depends on how you try to implement it. Decentralized authentication simply means that there is no central authority needed to verify your identity. Decentralized Identifiers are a special type of identifier (ID) that allows for decentralized, verified digital identification. A DID is any subject identified by the DID's controller (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.). Decentralized Authentication uses protocols such as [OpensID](https://openid.net/)
